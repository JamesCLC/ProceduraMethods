1) What am I trying to acheive?

	I'm trying to convert my Axiom to Matrix Transforms.

2) What methods can I use to acheive this?
	
	a) In the model.cpp, I can call LSystem.Parse() for each member of the instances array.
	b) I can try to pass the array to the LSystem and fill it up there.
	c) I can put the rules for Parsing my L-System into the model.cpp and just use GetAxiom().

3) What are the benefits/drawbacks of each?

	a) Performance overhead of function calling. Would become more significant as I expand the system.
	b) I'd need the LSystem to know what InstanceType is, so that Parse can accept a pointer to one.
		=> Could I use some pointer fuckery to do this?
	c) This is kinda messy, but would work.

4) Which one is my best bet?

	c) Is definitely the easiest. I'll start here, and try to get b) working for optimisation later.
