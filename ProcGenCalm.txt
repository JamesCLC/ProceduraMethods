It's going to be fine - there's plenty of time left for this coursework.

Pause, Process, Plan, Prioritise, Proceed.

Pause - What's the issue?

	The cubes are being stretched to infinity. 
	

Process - What are the likely causes?

	Chances are, this means that 
	the information getting used to transform the cubes is either far higher than I expect,
	or invalid information is being accessed (possibly due to my use of pointers.)

Plan - How can I go about trying to fix this?

	a) Scale back to one cube. ?
	1) Make sure sensible data is being loaded into the Index Buffer. ?
	2) Make sure this data is being sensible applied to each vertex. ?
	3) Double-check vertex input stuff to make sure that's right.
	4)

Prioritise - Which approach should I try next?
	- 

Proceed - Go through each plan until they are exhasuted, I am exhausted, or a solution is reached.

	The Matrix infromation getting packed into Index Buffer seems to be fine. The data is identicle from one instance to another,
	and the values don't seem to be terribly unreasonable.
